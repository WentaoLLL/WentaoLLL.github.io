                            in recent years. Presently, more than half of the
                            global population is estimated to be using
                            smartphones. The increase in mobile consumption has
                            driven eCommerce brands to shift their focus on
                            delivering a more mobile-optimized and personalized
                            shopping experience.</strong

                    <p>
                        Eventually, brands are substituting native mobile apps
                        with progressive web apps. PWAs are more than just a
                        medium for delivering a native app-like experience.
                        Moreover, the user-centric approach shall play a
                        significant role in defining the future of PWA in 2022
                        and the coming years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Google has defined PWAs as fast, reliable, and engaging.
                        However, PWAs are more than just that. It bridges the
                        gap between the downsides of a website and customer
                        expectations from a mobile app. eCommerce brands are
                        turning to PWAs in 2022 for addressing a range of
                        business- and customer-related problems. A PWA is built
                        and resides on the web but has functions similar to a
                        mobile app. In simple terms, a PWA is similar to a
                        mobile app that’s accessible with the help of a browser.

                    Furthermore, it uses cached data from a user’s previous
                    interactions, enabling it to work perfectly in an unstable
                    network connection. With a minimum budget requirement,
                    user-friendly functionalities, and growing demand for PWAs
                    in 2022, they are ideal for businesses trying to deliver an
                    enhanced user experience.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Here are the primary features you should consider while
                    developing your eCommerce store’s progressive web app in
                    2022.

                        style="margin: 0 auto"
                    />
                </div>
                <br />
                <h5>1) Native app-like experience</h5>
                <p>
                    The number of application users is expected to increase at a
                    staggering rate in the coming years. Thus, businesses have
                    endless possibilities for capitalizing on the opportunity by
                    going for a PWA in 2022. Regardless of the technologies and
                    frameworks on which PWAs are built, they look, feel, and
                    work like a native mobile app. PWAs compare favorably in
                    terms of an intuitive interface, performance, and
                    experience.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>2) SEO and discoverability</h5>
                <p>
                    Progressive web apps come with comprehensive functionalities
                    of websites, database access, and automatic data. Thus,
                    Google, Bing, and other search engines can index PWAs.
                    Eventually, it makes it easier for your customers to
                    discover and download your PWA in 2022. New Google
                    algorithms have also made it easier to discover PWAs on the
                    search engine. Furthermore, indexing progressive web apps
                    positively impact traffic and page views.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>3) Shareability</h5>
                <p>
                    Users don’t have to install PWAs mandatorily. They can
                    access a PWA through its URL. Since PWAs do not require
                    installation on devices, users can easily access the PWA via
                    a URL, significantly contributing to the high shareability
                    with potential customers.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>4) No downloads and installations</h5>
                <p>
                    Your customers wouldn’t have to download and install PWA
                    from an app store. They can install the web app straight
                    from the web browser to their device. Eventually, it reduces
                    the chances of a user abandoning a web page. The quick and
                    easy installation functionality has established PWAs
                    credibility as an easy-to-access and more viable option.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>5) No manual updates are required</h5>
                <p>
                    The need for manual updates does not arise with PWAs.
                    Progressive web apps are automatically updated in the
                    background without the user’s permission. PWAs automatically
                    update every time a user visits them, eliminating the need
                    to download and install batch changes. However, some PWAs
                    might send users a push notification informing them about
                    the coming update.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>6) Works on a slow network</h5>
                <p>
                    Progressive web apps can function on a slow and unstable
                    internet connection. The built-in service workers of PWAs
                    save and caches the content for displaying later when your
                    customers face an issue with their network connection.
                    Furthermore, it allows for accessing the PWA without
                    downloading it, particularly in terms of poor connectivity.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>7) Push notifications</h5>
                <p>
                    The push notification feature presents eCommerce brands with
                    excellent opportunities to retain customers. What makes push
                    notifications so effective? Well, it reminds customers of
                    abandoned carts, forgotten deals and offers, and more.
                    Brands can reach out to their customers more often and
                    effectively with highly noticeable push notifications.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>8) Platform and device agnosticism</h5>
                <p>
                    You wouldn’t have to lose customers when they switch to
                    different platforms and devices. PWAs have a universal
                    operating functionality, offering platform and device
                    compatibility and a unified user experience across all
                    touchpoints. Furthermore, PWAs ensure a similar user
                    experience across all devices and platforms. The highly
                    responsive and adaptable nature of PWAs shall hold the key
                    to a brighter future of PWA.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>9) Real-time background sync</h5>
                <p>
                    Service workers enable PWAs to perform an extremely
                    essential task, background sync. It allows the web app to
                    respond to critical requests once the connection’s
                    available, even if the request was made while offline.

                                Eventually, brands are substituting native
                                mobile apps with progressive web apps. PWAs are
                                more than just a medium for delivering a native
                                app-like experience. Moreover, the user-centric
                                approach shall play a significant role in
                                defining the future of PWA in 2022 and the
                                coming years.

                                engaging. However, PWAs are more than just that.
                                It bridges the gap between the downsides of a
                                website and customer expectations from a mobile
                                app. eCommerce brands are turning to PWAs in
                                2022 for addressing a range of business- and
                                customer-related problems. A PWA is built and
                                resides on the web but has functions similar to
                                a mobile app. In simple terms, a PWA is similar
                                to a mobile app that’s accessible with the help
                                of a browser.
